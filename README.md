   Play against the computer. Choose your move—rock, paper, or scissors—and see who wins! First to 5 points is the champion.

2. ### 🔢 Number Guessing Game  
   The computer picks a random number. Try to guess it in as few attempts as possible. You’ll get hints like “Too high” or “Too low”.

3. ### 🎯 Dot Clicker  
   Test your reflexes! Click on randomly appearing dots for 60 seconds as fast as you can. The faster you click, the higher your score.
